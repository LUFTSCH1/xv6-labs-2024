Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
  - usertrap

What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
  - 0x2，为一个系统调用号，代表SYS_exit

What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
  - $sstatus = 0x200000022，SPP (Bit 8) = 0，User Mode

Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
  - // num = p->trapframe->a7;
  - num = *(int *)0;
  - 80001c1e:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
  - 寄存器：a3

Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
  - 内核地址空间从`0x80000000`开始，`0x0`为用户地址空间起始，不在内核地址空间范围内  
  - RISC-V的CPU检测到内存非法访问后会触发load page fault异常，并自动设置scause寄存器记录原因。内核恐慌时scause寄存器内的值为`0xd`，含义为加载地址错误，证实了结论

What is the name of the process that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
  - 进程名：initcode，pid：1
