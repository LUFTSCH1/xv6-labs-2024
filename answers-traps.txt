Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
  - a0-a5寄存器。

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
  - 26: 45b1                	li	a1,12
  - 编译器直接计算出了固定结果，改为加载立即数。

At what address is the function printf located?
  - 6be: 711d                	add	sp,sp,-96，在6be处。

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
  - 是main中printf调用的下一条指令，0x34。

Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, (char *) &i);
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
  - 输出He110 World，大端模式需要改为0x726c6400，即反转字节顺序。

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
  - 未定义行为，就函数调用规则而言取决于a2寄存器在这时候的值，但是该值为垃圾数据。
